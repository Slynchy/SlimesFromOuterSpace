# SlimesFromOuterSpace
A silly little game, made as a demo to AtlaEngine and ModularPathFinding

# How to play
The goal is to avoid the red slimes while collecting as much treasure as possible. Once you think you've collected enough treasure, make your way to the down stairs to complete the level.
	
	
# Controls 
	WSAD = Movement
	F1 = Enable/disable debug mode (makes player invisible to AI if they are not already seeking the player)
	
	(Debug mode must be enabled to use these!)
	0 (zero) 		= Switch AI pathfinding algorithm
	= (equals) 		= Simulate the AI in realtime
	M and N 		= Zoom in and out
